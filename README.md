# EQBCHookin
Terribly written java client for meta-managing eq characters

The idea behind this is to use the java programming language to turbo charge the existing MacroQuest2 framework by creating a dummy "character" for offloading computation and logic from the characters.

I'm not super great at this whole programming thing, so the code is going to be awful, gaze upon it at your own peril.

The other half of this will probably be a few MacroQuest includes for handling some of the asynchronous request stuff.
